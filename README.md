# 👋 Hi, I'm Jakub Śledzikowski!

A **Self-Taught IT Engineer** with over 14 years of hands-on coding experience and a deep passion for building **efficient, standalone technology solutions from the ground up**. My journey in IT is one of organic exploration, where I develop my skills by solving real-world problems, often avoiding unnecessary dependencies and striving for a profound understanding of fundamental mechanisms.

I bridge the world of **advanced web development** with unique expertise in **CNC machine programming**, which translates into an engineering mindset, a keen eye for precision, and a focus on optimization.

## 🚀 My Core Competencies & Technologies:

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (8/10), JavaScript (6/10), **jQuery (9/10 – mastery level)**. Crafting advanced, dynamic UIs without relying on heavy frameworks.
*   **Backend:** Node.js (with an emphasis on native modules), PHP (5/10). Building robust and scalable server-side applications.
*   **AI & LLM:**
    *   **Practical Exploration:** Intensive testing and utilization of Open Source models (<70B parameters) on my own GPU infrastructure (3x RTX A5000, 72GB VRAM).
    *   **API Experience:** Extensive work with various LLM provider APIs (e.g., Gemini), with a consumption of **billions of tokens** (over 1.5 billion on Gemini API alone, ~4-4.5 billion total).
    *   **Tooling Development:** Building systems for unified LLM access, AI pipelines, and agents to enhance work with language models.
*   **Databases & Storage:** Designing and implementing lightweight, file-based JSON databases (with relational capabilities), caching systems (LRU, TTL), and Redis-like in-memory solutions.
*   **Tools & Other:** C++, Web Scraping, Parsers (HTML), Template Engines, Middleware (HTTP, Security, Proxy), Token Generation, Testing Systems.
*   **CNC Programming:** 7-8 years of experience with CNC machines (Fanuc, Heidenhain), contributing to precision and analytical thinking in IT.

## 💡 My Working Philosophy:

*   **Engineering Minimalism:** Striving for simplicity, control, and avoiding unnecessary dependencies. Every component must have its justification.
*   **Craftsmanship & Care:** Treating code as a craft that demands diligence, clarity, and attention to detail. I prefer object-oriented structures and functions, valuing readability.
*   **Performance Through Understanding:** A deep understanding of underlying mechanisms (e.g., Node.js Event Loop) allows me to consciously optimize solutions.
*   **Security "By Design":** An integral part of the design and implementation process from the outset.
*   **Pragmatic Problem Solving:** "There's no programming task I wouldn't accomplish" in the web context – confidence born from years of practice.

## 🛠️ Examples of Tools I Build:

While many of my projects remain private, I specialize in building tools such as:

*   **AI Systems:** Autonomous search agents, abstraction layers for LLMs, AI processing pipelines.
*   **Web Tools:** Lightweight backend frameworks, rendering engines, advanced parsers, and scrapers.
*   **Data Solutions:** Custom file-based database systems and caching mechanisms.
*   **Developer Utilities:** Test automation systems, helper libraries.

I own a powerful server infrastructure (including 3x RTX A5000 GPUs), which serves as my lab for experiments and ambitious projects, especially in the AI field.

## 🎯 What's Next?

After 14 years of independent exploration and building advanced solutions driven by passion, I am ready to bring my unique experience and skills into a commercial environment. I am looking for challenges that will allow me to grow further, particularly in AI, backend development, and creating innovative tools.
